# CMB Harmonic Analysis with Robust Multi-field Likelihood (CHARM-Like)

CHARM-Like is a package able to perform an angular power spectrum based CMB analysis
in a multi-field scenario.

Starting from a set of $N$ Gaussian correlated fields (T, E, B, frequency channels, or
data splits), it computes the posterior on the optical depth $\tau$ and the
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$.

CHARM-Like is used to obtain the results of [Galloni et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org)
(in prep.), so refer to that work for further details on the methodology.

For details on how to run the code, see the
[default configuration file](default_config.yaml).
